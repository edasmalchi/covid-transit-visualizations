# conda-freeze
A base repository to use for exporting conda environments.

The `environment.yml` file in this repository is empty on purpose.

It is meant to be used together with [repo2docker](https://repo2docker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
to provide an environment in which you can install and then export
your conda environment specification.
